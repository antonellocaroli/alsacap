==== Notes about the alsacap program ====

This is a simple autotools package for compiling and installing the 
alsacap command.  The alsacap command was written by Volker Schatz.

The alsacap command displays detailed information about the capabilities
of each sound card installed in your system.  It shows allowable
sampling rates, sampling formats, and min/max buffer & period sizes.


==== Notes about the package ====

The man page for the alsacap program uses the pod2man command so you
have to have that installed in order to generate it.

Other than that, this is a normal autotools package.  To make the 
distribution package run:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make dist

Then you'll get the alsacap-1.0.tar.gz file which you can distribute and
do the normal

./configure
make
make install

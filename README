==== Notes about the alsacap program ====

This is a simple autotools package for compiling and installing the 
alsacap command.  The alsacap command was written by Volker Schatz.

The alsacap command displays detailed information about the capabilities
of each sound card installed in your system.  It shows allowable
sampling rates, sampling formats, and min/max buffer & period sizes.


==== Notes about autotools packages ====

Autotools packages are super old school and work on just about every
unix system known to mankind because the only thing you need to install
one is a bourne shell.  

In case you've never worked with them before, this package right here
is the absolute simplest autotools package you could possibly find.   
This whole package is built around ONE source code file.


Here's a quick run down of how it works:

If you see a file called 'bootstrap' in this directory, then you are 
working with the developer's version of the package.   In that case,
you must have the autoconf and automake packages installed, then 
you have to run the following command:

 ./bootstrap

This will generate a 'configure' script and a Makefile.  Now you are at
the point that a normal user would see if they had just extracted
the distribution tarball.

If you don't see a file called 'bootstrap' in this directory OR you
have just run the above command, then run the following commands:

 ./configure
 make
 sudo make install

This will install the makeheaders command into /usr/local/bin and 
you're all set to go.

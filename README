This is an autotools package for the alsacap command.  It was originally
written by Volker Schatz and it shows the capabilities of alsa devices.

Here some sample output:

sysadmin@laptop:~$ alsacap

  Device 0, ID `Intel ICH', name `Intel ICH5', 1 subdevices (1 available)
    2 channels, sampling rate 8000..48000 Hz
    Sample formats: S16_LE, S32_LE
    Buffer size range from 4 to 16384
    Period size range from 4 to 16384

      Subdevice 0, name `subdevice #0'
  Device 4, ID `Intel ICH - IEC958', name `Intel ICH5 - IEC958', 1 subdevices (1 available)
    2 channels, sampling rate 48000..48000 Hz
    Sample formats: S16_LE
    Buffer size range from 8 to 16384
    Period size range from 8 to 16384

      Subdevice 0, name `subdevice #0'



==== Notes about the package ====

To build this package, you need the libasound external library and
the pod2man command.  The pod2man command builds the man page.

Other than that, this is a normal autotools package.  To make the 
distribution package run:

./bootstrap
./configure
make
make dist

Then you'll get the alsacap-1.0.tar.gz file which you can distribute and
do the normal

./configure
make
make install
